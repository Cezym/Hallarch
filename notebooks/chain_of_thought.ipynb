    "\n",
    "# Przeprowadzono eksperyment porównujący zachowanie modelu dla następujących konfiguracji promptu:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Baseline - prompt nakazujący odpowiedź wprost na pytanie, z pozycji eksperta\n",
    "\"You are an expert science examiner. Select the single best option and answer ONLY with the letter\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. CoT-visible - prompt nakazujący jawny łańcuch rozumowania, a następnie odpowiedź: treść rozumowania oraz wynik ostateczny\n",
    "\n",
    "3. CoT-hidden - prompt nakazujący niejawny łańcuch rozumowania, a następnie odpowiedź tylko ostateczną literą, bez dzielenia się przeprowadzonym \"rozumowaniem\"\n",

    "1. Wymuszenie namysłu (Chain-of-Thought) znacząco poprawia jakość odpowiedzi modelu w zadaniach multiple-choice.\n",
