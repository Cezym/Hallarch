Self-Consistency jest skuteczniejsze i bezpieczniejsze w zadaniach typu multiple choice: minimalnie poprawia wynik, zachowuje stabilność, prawie nie wprowadza szkodliwych flipów.\n",

    "2.Self-Critique bywa pomocny, ale jego skuteczność zależy od jakości krytyki; jeśli krytyka jest powierzchowna lub halucynacyjna, wzrost Accuracy może być mniejszy niż w Self-Consistency, a liczba zmian szkodliwych może rosnąć tak jak w przypadku tego data setu. Self-Critique w tej konfiguracji tworzy “nad-rozumowanie” i halucynacje: krytyka bez twardych reguł oparcia o treść pytania/opcji generuje wymyślone “fakty” i zmienia poprawne odpowiedzi na błędne. Wysoki odsetek zmian i przewaga zmian szkodliwych w Self-Critique to proxy halucynacji (model konfabuluje powody zmiany).\n",
